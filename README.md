assignment for 507 Module1
I followed the requirements of this assignment step by step after I read the inpatient data. I want to figure out how many variables are in the data, and what types they were. Then I run the frequency of the top 5 most common ICD code (ICD_DGNS_CD1), DRG code(CLM_DRG_CD), and HCPCS code(HCPCS_CD) frequency. The variable (ICD_DGNS_CD1) shows Z73. 3(Stress, not elsewhere classified) are the most, then followed by Z608( other problems related to social environment), T74.32XD( Child psychological abuse, Z604( Social exclusion and rejection), Z940(Kidney transplant status). Then I try to describe a float type variable which is “REV_CNTR_DDCTBL_COINSRNC_CD”, the outcome shows mean is 2.898, std is 0.3198, min is 0.0000, max is 3.000.
